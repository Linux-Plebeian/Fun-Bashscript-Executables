# Fun-Bashscript-Executables
Just some fun bashscript programs I made as I learn how to use it.
Make sure to chmod +x the file so it can be recognized as a linux executable

What they do:

opinionsettler.sh - randomly and unbiasedly resoponds "yes", "no", not necessarily", and "maybe" to questions like "is mariokart good" or "is the rtx 4090 over rated"

yapperbot.sh - randomly spits out fun facts

More to be added soon!
