# Fun-Bashscript-Executables
Just some fun bashscript programs I made as I learn how to use it.
Make sure to chmod +x the file so it can be recognized as a linux executable

What they do:

opinionsettler.sh - randomly and unbiasedly resoponds to yes/no questions

Yapperbot.sh - responds "yes" or "no" to questions.

More to be added soon!
